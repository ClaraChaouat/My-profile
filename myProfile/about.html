        <h1>A bit about myself...</h1>

        <h2>From a research scientist to a web developer or why I decided to learn how to code?</h2>

        <h2>How good chemistry,biology skills and a strong willingness to travel lead to research scientist career </h2>

        <h3>Time for studies</h3>

        <div class = text>
          <p>Let's start the story ay the age of 18. You just graduated from high school, don't know much about life and how to make the most of it. So you choose to study what you're good at. For me, it was chemistry and biology.<br><br>

            Because it could lead to a variety of job openings related to chemistry and biology, I decided to study pharmaceutical sciences.<br><br>

        Here we were, enrolled for six years of pharmaceuticals sciences.The first year is selective.To go into the second year, there is a very selective competition; about 1200 people registered, only 230 admitted. Strong competition. Hard work, lot of dedication.<br><br>

        June 2002, the hour of results has come, the heart is beating strong... <strong>Rank : 115 - Admitted - </strong>I did it!<br>
        Here I was embarked for six years of pharmaceutical sciences studies. From animal biology to organic chemistry, including genetics, studying pharmaceutical sciences allows you to get knowledges in many different fields.<br><br>

        My favorite topic was galenic or "the art of mixing ingredients to make new products". I knew from that point that I wanted to work in research and development. <br>To confirm that strong interest in that field I had the opportunity to work as a research scientist for two companies. PIERRE FABRE pharmaceuticals was the first company to give me a chance. I worked on the formulation of syrups and dermatological emulsions.<br>
        In a different field, I had the opportunity to work for l'Oreal as a formulation scientist where my mission was to reformulate a paraben free foundation.

        <br><br>Knowing my strong interest in the field of galenic, one of my professor at university advised me to keep on studying by doing a PhD in physical chemistry. What I did!<br>
        I did a PhD in physical chemistry, sponsored by the PIERRE FABRE company, in Toulouse (south ouest of France) where I worked on the development of drug delivery systems for dermatological use fo three years. </p></div>

        <h3>Fresh air needed!</h3>
        <p>After studying for 9 years, I needed some fresh air and wanted to practice english.So I decided to travel to Australia with a working holiday. The goal was to practice English as much as I could.At the beginng, I had casual jobs but then I had the opportunity to get an australian permanent residency thanks to skilled visa (At that period of time, Australia was looking for people for high qualifications in chemistry).<br>
        Having this permanent residency helped me to get access to better job positions. That's how I worked as a technical sales repressantive for a cosmetic  ingredients supplier in Sydney.  </p>

        <h3>Back to France</h3>
        <p>After spending three years in Australia, I went back to France where I worked for a year as a research scientist in Rennes (Brittany) for a year, for a pharmaceutical supplier called Capsugel.</p>

        <h2>Stay competitive in the job market by getting new skills...By getting coding skills</h2>
        <p>At that periode of time, I realized how the job market was changing as the need for tech skills was growing.<br>Steve Jobs said in an interview :
         <blockquote>
             <p><i>"Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer because it teaches you how to think."</i></p>
         </blockquote>
         I then decided to get more information about those tech jobs what lead me to learn how to code.</p>

        <h2>Reasons to learn how to code ?</h2>

        <img class= "displayed" src = "https://www.itstarterseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/programmer.jpg" alt = "Reasons to become a programmer">

        <ol class = "reasons">
            <li>Develop A More Creative and Structured Way of Thinking</li>
        <p>When a computer programmer is given a problem that needs solving, they don’t begin to write program code right off the bat. No problem is ever solved in that way. First, it must be broken down into smaller more manageable chunks and then each one tackled as its own problem, a part of the whole. Most non-programmers will not do this, not with any problem. They will attempt to solve the problem as a whole and, on most occasions, they are doomed to failure.</p>

        <img class = "displayed" src = "https://www.itstarterseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/structure.jpeg" alt = "Problem solving">
        </p>

        <li>Make your life easier</li>
        <p>Learning how to become a programmer will teach you the even a few simple lines of code can do so much to make life easier for you. If something will only work when a few buttons are pushed, program your smartphone to do it with one tap. By using programming, you too can make life much simpler for yourself.</p>

        <li>Learn persistence</li>
        <p>When you begin to learn how to program, you begin to see all problems in the light of their solutions and your brain begins to function in that way. When you have learned how to program and you face a problem, you begin to see the possible solutions and you may, if you are lucky, begin to see some good results. It really doesn’t matter how hard a problem you face, you will become determined to solve it and you will find yourself being turned into an individual who is driven by solutions.</p>

        <li>An amazing career</li>
        <p>This is probably one of the very best reasons to become a computer programmer – there are so many jobs available to you. The world is turning digital, we are increasingly becoming more reliant as a society on technology and as a result, there are more and more computer programming jobs to choose from and this will not change in the foreseeable future.As many other industries begin their decline, computer programming is enjoying a huge period of growth and expansion in almost every area of our lives. If you can write computer programs, you are eminently employable or you could just start your own business.</p>

        <img class = "displayed" src = "https://www.itstarterseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/career.jpg" alt = "Programming carrer">

        <li>Be in control</li>
        <p>Computers are a huge part of our lives and, to a large extent, we couldn’t live without them anymore. Whether we like it or not, the age of technology is here. </p>    
        
        <li>Think like a programmer</li>
        <p>When you can think like a computer programmer does, you will start relating that to your real life.By learning how to program you learn how to be more efficient at solving problems.</p>

        <li>Make anything</li>
        <p>One of the best things about computer programming is that you can pretty much make whatever you want. It could be an app that automates something, making you more productive; it could be your own micro social network for you and a few friends; a website for your business, anything. Programming opens up so many doors and widens your potential significantly.</p>

        <h2>About my hobbies....</h2>

        <h3>Crossfit addict</h3>

        <p>I've been doing crossfit for 3 years now. It became an addiction. More than a way of training, it became a way of living. I go to my crossfit gym at least four times a week and I enjoy to visit other crossfit gyms when I travel to different countries.</p>

        <h3>Books lover</h3>
        <p> Reading is one of my therapy.Depending on the type of books I read, reading allows me to learn new things, escape to different universes and open my mind to other approaches of life.<br>
        I always have a book with me and buying a book makes me happier than a pair of shoes.  </p>

        <h3>Mad traveler</h3>
        <p>The healthiest addiction on earth! <br>
        I had the chance to start travelling and discovering our lovely planet since I was very young as my parents had this travel bug.I travelled to something like 30 countries and I'm still keen on  keeping on discovering new ones.</p>

        <h3>Fine jewelry maker</h3>
        <p>I had the opportuny to be graduated in fine jewelry making.<br>
        I really enjoy using my hands to make things with a high degree of accuracy. There are several different amazing things with jewelry:
        <ul>
            <li>First, you make something concrete, something that people can see, touch and wear,</li>
            <li>Then, a piece jewelry is something you can passed down from generation to generation. It can have its own history, </li>
            <li>Finally, making a piece of jewelry is like leavig a trace of yourself in the world. </li>
        </ul></p>
